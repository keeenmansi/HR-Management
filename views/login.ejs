                        Born out of a necessity, FL started in 2006. Our parent, Open Source IT Consulting company,
                        Keen and Able (KNA), had a consistent need to find relevant people. Paucity of right
                        personnel was impacting business. We realised that most of the schools and colleges are
                        unable to instil the skills, depth, initiative and application required by people in their
                        careers. We were confident that since we knew what customers needed, we would be able to
                        impart practicality to the learning process and prepare people who are ready to work in the
                        real world out there...

                        FL has always been about people. WE do not claim that we can 'train' people well. What we
                        try to achieve is provide an all rounded learning environment to joinees to help them think,
                        think openly. We have realised that our education system does not promote querying. We try
                        to instil a knack of asking questions in our pupil. We firmly believe that once we get into
                        the habit of asking the right questions, we can find all the relevant answers.
